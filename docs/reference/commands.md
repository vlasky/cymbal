# Commands

All commands support `--json` for structured output. Each repo gets its own database in the OS cache directory, auto-resolved from your working directory (`~/.cache/cymbal/repos/<hash>/index.db` on Linux, `~/Library/Caches/cymbal/repos/<hash>/index.db` on macOS, `%LOCALAPPDATA%\cymbal\repos\<hash>\index.db` on Windows).

Path/language heuristics recognize some special filenames such as `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `Jenkinsfile`, and `CMakeLists.txt` even though they are not parseable/indexable languages.

## Global Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-d, --db <path>` | Override path to cymbal database (default: auto-resolved per repo) |
| `--json` | Output as JSON instead of frontmatter+content |

Passive update notices are suppressed automatically for `--json` output. Set `CYMBAL_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER=1` to disable passive update notices entirely.

---

## Graph Output

Add `--graph` to `trace`, `impact`, `importers`, or `impls` when you want a
high-level relationship map rather than call-site detail.

- Default format is Mermaid on a TTY and JSON when piped.
- Use `--graph-format mermaid|dot|json` to force a specific format.
- Use `--graph-limit <n>` to cap dense graphs by degree.
- `impact --graph` defaults to depth `1` unless you explicitly pass `--depth`.
- `--include-unresolved` is useful on symbol graphs when external relationships matter.

Stay with the normal text or JSON output when you need exact source lines,
call sites, or detail you will edit against.

---

## `cymbal index`

Index a directory for symbol discovery.

```sh
cymbal index [path] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--exclude <glob>` | Exclude files whose path matches this glob during indexing (repeatable) |
| `-f, --force` | Force re-index all files |
| `--include-generated` | Index generated files that cymbal skips by default |
| `--include-large-files` | Index large source files that cymbal skips by default |
| `-w, --workers <n>` | Number of parallel workers (0 = NumCPU) |

```sh
# Index current directory
cymbal index .

# Force re-index with 8 workers
cymbal index . --force --workers 8

# Skip an additional generated subtree
cymbal index . --exclude 'src/generated/**'
```

---

## `cymbal version`

Print build/version information and cached release status.

```sh
cymbal version [--json]
```

- Human output includes the current build information and, when available, a suggested update command.
- `--json` adds a structured `update` object with `checked_at`, `cache_stale`, `available`, `latest_version`, `install_type`, `command`, `release_url`, and `source`.
- `cymbal --version` stays terse and only prints the installed version.

---

## `cymbal ls`

Show file tree, repo list, or repo statistics.

```sh
cymbal ls [path] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-D, --depth <n>` | Max tree depth (0 = unlimited) |
| `--repos` | List all indexed repositories |
| `--stats` | Show repo overview (languages, file/symbol counts) |

```sh
# File tree
cymbal ls

# Top-level only
cymbal ls --depth 1

# Repo stats
cymbal ls --stats

# All indexed repos
cymbal ls --repos
```

---

## `cymbal structure`

Show the structural shape of the indexed codebase. All data is derived from the
existing index. Reports entry points, most referenced symbols, most imported
files, and largest packages. Designed to answer "I've never seen this repo —
where do I start?"

```sh
cymbal structure [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-n, --limit <n>` | Max items per section (default: 10) |

```sh
cymbal structure
cymbal structure --limit 5
cymbal structure --json
```

---

## `cymbal outline`

Show symbols defined in a file.

```sh
cymbal outline <file> [file2 ...] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-s, --signatures` | Show full parameter signatures |

```sh
cymbal outline internal/auth/handler.go
cymbal outline internal/auth/handler.go --signatures
cymbal outline internal/auth/handler.go internal/auth/service.go --names
```

---

## `cymbal search`

Search symbols by name, or use `--text` for full-text grep. Results are ranked: exact match > prefix > fuzzy.

```sh
cymbal search <query> [path ...] [flags]
```

Trailing path operands are accepted as `--path` filters, which matches common
`rg` usage: `cymbal search --text <pattern> cmd internal/foo.go`.
In symbol mode, multiple query arguments are searched independently:
`cymbal search Foo Bar Baz`.

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-t, --text` | Full-text grep across file contents |
| `-e, --exact` | Exact name match only |
| `-k, --kind <type>` | Filter by symbol kind (function, class, method, etc.) |
| `-l, --lang <name>` | Filter by language (go, python, typescript, etc.) |
| `-n, --limit <n>` | Max results (default: 20) |
| `--path <glob>` | Include only results whose path matches this glob or path fragment (repeatable) |
| `--exclude <glob>` | Exclude results whose path matches this glob or path fragment (repeatable) |
| `--stdin` | Read additional symbol queries from stdin |

```sh
# Symbol search
cymbal search handleAuth

# Batch symbol search
cymbal search PatchMulti MultiEdit EditTool PatchTool

# Full-text grep
cymbal search "TODO" --text

# Full-text grep scoped to files/directories, rg-style
cymbal search --text 'os\.WriteFile\(' tools/file.go tools/patch.go

# Only Go functions
cymbal search parse --kind function --lang go
```

---

## `cymbal show`

Read source code by symbol name or file path.

```sh
cymbal show <symbol|file[:L1-L2]> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-C, --context <n>` | Lines of context around the target |

If the argument contains `/` or ends with a known extension, it's treated as a file path. Otherwise, it's treated as a symbol name.

```sh
# Show a symbol's source
cymbal show handleAuth

# Show a file
cymbal show internal/auth/handler.go

# Show specific lines
cymbal show internal/auth/handler.go:80-120

# Show with surrounding context
cymbal show handleAuth -C 5
```

---

## `cymbal context`

Show bundled context for a symbol: source code, callers, and imports of the
defining file (plus referenced types in `--json` output). The single best
command for "I'm about to edit this symbol".

```sh
cymbal context <symbol> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-n, --callers <n>` | Max callers to show (default: 20) |

```sh
cymbal context OpenStore
cymbal context ParseFile --callers 10
```

---

## `cymbal diff`

Show the git diff for a symbol's line range. Resolves the symbol to a file and
line range, then runs `git diff` filtered to only hunks that overlap the
symbol's definition.

```sh
cymbal diff <symbol> [base] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--stat` | Show diffstat for the whole defining file (not symbol-filtered) |

```sh
# diff vs HEAD
cymbal diff ParseFile

# diff vs main branch
cymbal diff ParseFile main

# diff vs specific commit
cymbal diff ParseFile abc123

# show diffstat only
cymbal diff --stat ParseFile
```

---

## `cymbal importers`

Find files that import a given file or package.

```sh
cymbal importers <file|package> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-D, --depth <n>` | Import chain depth (max 3, default: 1) |
| `-n, --limit <n>` | Max results (default: 50) |
| `--graph` | Render target's fan-in as a visual graph |
| `--graph-format <fmt>` | `mermaid`, `dot`, or `json` (implies `--graph`) |
| `--graph-limit <n>` | Cap the graph size by degree (0 for no cap) |

```sh
cymbal importers internal/auth
cymbal importers internal/auth --graph
```

---

## `cymbal impls`

Find types that implement an interface, or elements an explicit type implements.

```sh
cymbal impls <symbol> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-n, --limit <n>` | Max results (default: 50) |
| `--of <type>` | Inverse: find interfaces that the given `<type>` implements |
| `--unresolved` | Only show external / unresolved targets |
| `--graph` | Render inheritance as a visual graph |
| `--graph-format <fmt>` | `mermaid`, `dot`, or `json` (implies `--graph`) |
| `--include-unresolved`| Graph unresolved external nodes as dashed `ext:` boxes |
| `--graph-limit <n>` | Cap the graph size by degree (0 for no cap) |

```sh
cymbal impls io.Reader
cymbal impls --of MyStruct --graph --include-unresolved
```

---

## `cymbal refs`

Find references to a symbol across indexed files.

```sh
cymbal refs <symbol> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-n, --limit <n>` | Max results (default: 50) |
| `--importers` | Find files that import the defining file |
| `--impact` | Transitive impact analysis (`--importers --depth 2`) |
| `-D, --depth <n>` | Import chain depth for `--importers` (max 3, default: 1) |

References are best-effort based on AST name matching, not semantic analysis. Results are deduplicated — identical call sites in the same file are grouped.

```sh
# Direct references
cymbal refs handleAuth

# Who imports this package?
cymbal refs handleAuth --importers

# Transitive impact
cymbal refs handleAuth --impact
```

---

## `cymbal investigate`

Kind-adaptive investigation — returns the right shape of context for whatever a
symbol is, so you don't have to choose between `search`, `show`, `refs`, and
`impact`.

```sh
cymbal investigate <symbol> [symbol2 ...] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--stdin` | Read additional symbol names (newline-separated) from stdin |
| `--resolve-scope <s>` | `same` \| `family` \| `all` (default: family) |

What you get back depends on the symbol's kind:

- function / method → source + callers + shallow impact
- class / struct / type / interface → source + members + references
- ambiguous name → auto-resolves to the best match and notes the alternatives

Disambiguate with a file or parent hint (`config.go:Config`, `auth.Middleware`),
and pass several names (or pipe newline-separated names via `--stdin`) to
investigate a batch.

```sh
cymbal investigate OpenStore
cymbal investigate config.go:Config     # file hint
cymbal investigate Foo Bar Baz          # batch
cymbal outline svc.go -s --names | cymbal investigate --stdin
```

---

## `cymbal trace`

Downward call trace — what does this symbol call? Complementary to `impact`,
which traces callers upward.

```sh
cymbal trace <symbol> [symbol2 ...] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--depth <n>` | Max traversal depth (default: 3) |
| `-n, --limit <n>` | Max results per symbol (default: 50) |
| `--kinds <list>` | Comma-separated ref kinds to follow: `call`, `use`, `implements` (default: `call`) |
| `--stdin` | Read additional symbol names (newline-separated) from stdin |
| `--resolve-scope <s>` | `same` \| `family` \| `all` (default: family) |
| `--include-unresolved` | Keep callees that don't resolve to an indexed symbol (stdlib, third-party, builtins); dashed `ext:` nodes under `--graph` |
| `--graph` | Render the call tree as a visual graph |
| `--graph-format <fmt>` | `mermaid`, `dot`, or `json` (implies `--graph`) |
| `--graph-limit <n>` | Cap the graph size by degree (0 for no cap) |

By default `trace` follows only invocation edges (`call`) and drops callees that
don't resolve to an indexed symbol. `--include-unresolved` keeps those external
callees in the text/JSON output (and renders them as dashed `ext:` nodes under
`--graph`). Like `impact`, `trace` reports `truncated` when a per-symbol
`--limit` is hit. Pass several names (or pipe via `--stdin`) for the union of
callees, deduplicated with a `hit_symbols` attribution list.

```sh
cymbal trace handleRegister                      # call chain (depth 3)
cymbal trace handleRegister --depth 5            # deeper trace
cymbal trace Save Load Delete                    # union of callees
cymbal trace handleRegister --include-unresolved # keep stdlib/external calls
cymbal outline svc.go -s --names | cymbal trace --stdin
```

---

## `cymbal impact`

Transitive caller analysis — what is impacted if a symbol changes.

```sh
cymbal impact <symbol> [symbol2 ...] [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-D, --depth <n>` | Max call-chain depth (max 5, default: 2) |
| `-n, --limit <n>` | Max callers per symbol (default: 50) |
| `--no-tests` | Exclude callers in test files (keeps production + unknown) |
| `--test-path <pat>` | Classify matching paths as test code, in addition to the built-in conventions (substring, or glob with `**`; repeatable) |
| `--resolve-scope <s>` | `same` \| `family` \| `all` (default: family) |

Callers are classified by file path as **production**, **test**, or **unknown**,
so the header reports the real blast radius rather than a bare count:

```sh
$ cymbal impact Index --depth 1
total_callers: 29 (5 production, 24 test)
references: 39 (8 production, 31 test) in 12 (4 production, 8 test)
```

- `truncated: true` is shown (and emitted in `--json`) when a per-symbol
  `--limit` was hit, so a partial caller set is never presented as complete.
- The `references` line / JSON `metrics` block are exact, un-truncated counts of
  references to the symbol (reference sites and distinct files, split by class) —
  true breadth even when callers are capped. They are name-scoped: an ambiguous
  name (several definitions) is flagged via `definition_count` / `definitions`.
- `--no-tests` drops test-file callers; classification happens during traversal,
  so test callers never consume the `--limit` budget ahead of production ones.
  In `--graph` mode, hidden test nodes are contracted: a production caller
  reachable only through a test helper stays connected to the seed via a dashed
  edge marked `"indirect": true` in the JSON.
- `--test-path` extends the built-in test classification with repo-specific
  patterns (e.g. `--test-path qa/ --test-path '**/*_it.go'`) for layouts the
  conventions don't cover. It affects the caller split, `--no-tests`, and the
  `metrics` block on both `impact` and `changed`.

```sh
# only the production callers worth inspecting
cymbal impact Index --no-tests

# treat the qa/ tree as test code too
cymbal impact Index --no-tests --test-path qa/
```

`trace` likewise reports `truncated` when its `--limit` is hit.

---

## `cymbal changed`

Diff-scoped impact — map a git diff to the symbols it touches and report each
one's references and transitive impact in a single call.

```sh
cymbal changed [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--staged` | Diff the staged changes (index vs HEAD) instead of the working tree |
| `--base <ref>` | Diff the working tree against another single ref (e.g. `main`) |
| `-D, --depth <n>` | Max call-chain depth for impact (max 5, default: 2) |
| `-n, --limit <n>` | Max callers per changed symbol (default: 50) |
| `--max-symbols <n>` | Max changed symbols to analyze (default: 40, 0 = unlimited) |
| `--max-impact <n>` | Soft cap on total caller rows across symbols (default: 500) |
| `--no-tests` | Exclude callers in test files from impact |
| `--test-path <pat>` | Classify matching paths as test code, in addition to the built-in conventions (substring, or glob with `**`; repeatable) |
| `--resolve-scope <s>` | `same` \| `family` \| `all` (default: family) |

Defaults to **unstaged** working-tree changes (`git diff`). Changed symbols are
attributed by parsing the actual diffed blobs on both sides: added/modified lines
map to symbols in the new version, deleted lines to symbols in the old version.
So whole-symbol deletions are **named** (listed under `deleted`), `--staged`
attribution matches the staged content even with unstaged edits present, and
each changed line maps to its enclosing navigable definition.

```sh
# what does my uncommitted edit affect?
$ cymbal changed
changed_symbols: 1
base: working tree
---
# ClassifyPath  (index/classify.go)
  references: 6 (4 production, 2 test) in 6 (4 production, 2 test)
  impact: 14 (12 production, 2 test) callers
```

```sh
cymbal changed --staged        # staged changes (index vs HEAD)
cymbal changed --base main     # working tree vs your branch point
cymbal changed --json          # full structured payload for agents
```

Operates only on the current worktree. Counts are name-scoped (cymbal resolves
references by name); arbitrary commit ranges (`a..b`) and deleted-symbol impact
are out of scope. Deleted/binary/unsupported files are reported, not silently
dropped.

---

## `cymbal hook`

Agent-integration helpers for session reminders, shell nudges, and supported
agent installers.

```sh
cymbal hook <subcommand> [flags]
```

### `cymbal hook remind`

Print the short persistent guidance block agents should treat as system
context.

```sh
cymbal hook remind [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format <fmt>` | `text` (default), `json`, or `claude-code` |
| `--update <mode>` | `cache` (default) or `if-stale` |

- `--update=cache` uses cached update status only.
- `--update=if-stale` performs a bounded live update check only when cache is stale or missing.
- Reminder output can surface update guidance, but cymbal still never self-updates by default.

### `cymbal hook notify`

Emit a structured update notification payload for agent plugins that want to
surface update notices outside hidden system context.

```sh
cymbal hook notify [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format <fmt>` | `json` (default) or `text` |
| `--update <mode>` | `cache` (default) or `if-stale` |

- Returns `{"notify": true, ...}` with version and command when an update is available and the notification throttle allows it.
- Returns `{"notify": false}` when no update is available or the user was already notified recently.
- `text` format prints a plain notice; empty output when no notice is due.
- Respects `CYMBAL_NO_UPDATE_NOTIFIER`.
- Uses cymbal's per-version notification throttle (24h TTL).

### `cymbal hook nudge`

Inspect a would-be shell command and, if it looks like code navigation through
`rg`, `grep`, `find`, or `fd`, emit a cymbal suggestion.

```sh
cymbal hook nudge [--format <fmt>] [-- <command> [args...]]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format <fmt>` | `claude-code` (default), `text`, or `json` |

- Exit code is always `0`.
- `text` writes the suggestion to stderr.
- `json` emits a generic `suggest` / `why` payload for non-Claude integrations.

### `cymbal hook install`

Install cymbal-managed integration for a supported agent.

```sh
cymbal hook install <agent> [flags]
```

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--scope <scope>` | `user` (default) or `project` |
| `--dry-run` | Print the target path and intended managed content without writing |

Supported agents:

- `opencode`
- `claude-code`

Examples:

```sh
cymbal hook install opencode
cymbal hook install opencode --scope project
cymbal hook install opencode --scope project --dry-run
cymbal hook install claude-code
```

For `opencode`, re-running install upgrades the existing cymbal-managed plugin
file in place. The managed plugin is written with OpenCode's single `CymbalPlugin`
export shape and nudges Bash, Grep, and Glob tool calls toward cymbal-first code
navigation. If a non-cymbal file already exists at cymbal's target path, install
refuses to overwrite it.

Only one cymbal-managed OpenCode scope is supported at a time. If a managed
plugin already exists in the other scope, install refuses until that scope is
uninstalled.

### `cymbal hook uninstall`

Remove cymbal-managed integration for a supported agent.

```sh
cymbal hook uninstall <agent> [flags]
```

The same `--scope` and `--dry-run` flags apply.

For `opencode`, uninstall removes only the cymbal-managed plugin file and
leaves unrelated user-owned files untouched.
